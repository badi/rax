Description
===========

This python modules provides wrappers for dealing with Folding@Home/Folding@Work (FaH/FaW) style analysis results.
It provides classes and methods abstracting the reading and manipulation of the raw data to make the higher level analysis easier.

Data must be organized using a specific directory structure and file:
Each FaH/FaW generation should have a corresponding comma-separated-file storing the run, clone, generation, frame, and analysis value:

    path/to/root/RUN0000/CLONE0001/GEN0002.dat

For example:

    $ head -4 analysis/rmsd/C-alpha/RUN1234/CLONE4567/GEN4242.dat
	1234,4567,4242,0,0.935594
	1234,4567,4242,1,0.919145
	1234,4567,4242,2,0.918547
	1234,4567,4242,3,0.934575


Example usage
=============

Given a directory such as 'analysis/rmsd/C-alpha/RUN*/CLONE*/GEN*.dat, one could write something like the following:

 import fax
 
 root	= 'analysis/rmsd/C-alpha'
 ncores	= 42
 pool	= fax.start_pool(42)
 
 # read in the data using 42 cores
 project = fax.load_project(root, pool=pool)
 
 # a function to process each trajectory
 def my_analysis(traj):
 	return "magic result"
 
 # get the results
 results = fax.process_trajectories(project, my_analysis, pool=pool)
 
 # finish up
 fax.terminate_pool(pool)
